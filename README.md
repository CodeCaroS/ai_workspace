# MythOs Aegis

MythOs Aegis is a repository of skills for agentic coding work.

The canonical inventory lives in [`agents.json`](./agents.json). This README is
the human-readable map of the same set.

## Skills

- `.agents/skills/academix/` for academic research and source evaluation
- `.agents/skills/apocalypse/` for pre-mortems and failure analysis
- `.agents/skills/fact-checker/` for claim verification
- `.agents/skills/pre-launch-security-gate/` for security review before release
- `.agents/skills/skill-optimizer/` for optimizing Markdown-based skills
- `.agents/skills/crawler-readiness-audit/` for indexability and crawler-readiness checks
- `.agents/skills/quick-recap/` for mandatory end-of-response status footers
- `.agents/skills/prompt-preflight/` for silent prompt refinement before execution
- `.agents/skills/rigorous-response/` for concise reasoning and premise checks
- `.agents/skills/shepherd/` for reversible execution, checkpoints, and recovery
- `.agents/skills/ux-logic-loop/` for user-story inventory and test loops
- `.agents/skills/visual-flow-storyboard/` for user-journey reconstruction
- `.agents/skills/visual-pr-review/` for pull request review and implementation planning

## Canonical Skill Frontmatter

Every `SKILL.md` uses the same frontmatter shape:

```yaml
---
name: <slug>
description: <short summary>
version: <semantic version>
author: Caro
license: Apache-2.0
tags:
  - <topic>
  - <topic>
# optional sections when relevant:
# triggers:
# capabilities:
# outputs:
# modes:
# requires:
# optional:
# constraints:
---
```

Keep the key order stable so the skills read the same way across the repo.

## What this repo is for

This repo is not an application. It is a skill library and workflow toolkit for
coding agents.

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file with frontmatter metadata and behavior
guidance. The skills are meant to be read by the agent at task time so it can
pick the right workflow without inventing one from scratch.

## Working with the skills

- Read the relevant `SKILL.md` before changing behavior.
- Keep skill edits bounded and evidence-based.
- Use `.agents/skills/skill-optimizer/` when you need to improve a Markdown
  skill through a measured loop.

## Repo conventions

- `AGENTS.md` contains workspace-level instructions.
- `agents.json` is the machine-readable inventory.
- Each skill stays in its own directory.
- Local helper skills remain under `.agents/skills/`.
